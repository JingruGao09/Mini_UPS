1. when we write to protobuf, if we write the message in another function, we should pass the protobuf using pointer,

2. database conflict, currently do not know how to handle with it.   what():  Started transaction<READ COMMITTED> while transaction<READ COMMITTED> still active
3. update database query syntax simutaneously. Keep them same.
